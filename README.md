## General Information

This is an introductory course in statistics and data analysis. All you need to follow this course is calculus, linear algebra, and some knowledge of Python. 

The `Practical Data Analysis.ipynb` notebook contains a compendium of information on statistics. From basic definitions to complex theorems. This main notebook is divided into lessons. If needed, another notebook or document will be listed for further studies (`Sampler.ipynb` and `usefull_proofs.xopp` for instance). 

Furthermore, there are some practice exercises for each lesson. The solutions for these exercises are presented in the `Assigment.ipynb`.


## Technologies Used
- Python 3.10
- Jupyter Notebooks


## Features
This repository currently has:
- Statistics studies notebook;
- Exercises with solutions;
- Module with basic functions created from scratch;
- Inverse Transform Sampler.
